Least-squares linear regressions of contact number vs area for each edge, weighted by the reciprocal of the contact number to reduce leverage by high-$n$ edges.
\textbf{A)} Joint regression line for all edges (black dashed line), $y = 0.014x + 0.002, R^2 = 0.905$.
\textbf{B)} For each circuit, a zoomed-in region of \textbf{A}, showing the joint regression (grey dotted line) and the circuit-specific regression line (black dashed line).
broad-PN $y = 0.009x + 0.001, R^2 = 0.870$;
ORN-PN $y = 0.018x + 0.014, R^2 = 0.967$ (\dagger points towards exclude outliers);
LN-Basin $y = 0.015x + 0.002, R^2 = 0.675$;
cho-Basin $y = 0.013x + 0.006, R^2 = 0.909$.
Left-right pairs, when unambiguous, are shown in the same colour and joined with a dashed line of that colour.
