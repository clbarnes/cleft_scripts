Least-squares linear regressions of contact number vs area for each edge, weighted by the reciprocal of the contact number to reduce leverage by high-$n$ edges.
\textbf{A)} Joint regression line for all edges (black dashed line), $y = 0.014x + 0.002, R^2 = 0.905$.
\textbf{B)} For each circuit, a zoomed-in region of \textbf{A}, showing the joint regression (grey dotted line) and the circuit-specific regression line (black dashed line).
Left-right pairs, when unambiguous, are shown in the same colour and joined with a dashed line of that colour.
\textdagger shows outliers beyond the limits of the ORN-PN plot.
\textbf{C)} Table of regression line gradient ($\mu m^2 \textrm{count}^{-1}$ to 3 decimal places), $y$-intercept ($\mu m^2$ to 3 decimal places), and coefficient of determination $R^2$ (to 3 decimal places).
