The anatomy and connectivity of the four circuits of interest.
Presynaptic partners are shown in red, and postsynaptic in blue: synaptic sites are shown in cyan.
PN-containing circuits are anterior XY projections.
Basin-containing circuits are dorsal XZ projections.
The connectivity matrices are have presynaptic partners on the Y axis, and postsynaptic partners on the X axis.
Ambiguous pairs of neurons (lch5-2/4 and vchA/B, which are indistinguishable as their cell bodies lie outside the VNC) are distinguished by a truncated reconstruction ID.
Squares in the connectivity matrix are coloured by what fraction of the target's dendritic input, by contact number, is represented by that edge.
The absolute number of contacts is also included.
