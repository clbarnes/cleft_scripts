Results of synaptic area labelling.
\textbf{Ai)} The ssTEM images upon which the analysis is based.
\textbf{Aii)} A schematic showing the plane of a neurite sectioned in the top image, and the pre- and post-synaptic sites of that neurite and one of its partners, in orange and red respectively.
Note the T-bar, cleft and and postsynaptic membrane specialisation.
\textbf{Bi)} For each of the four circuits, the distribution of synaptic areas on a $log_{10}$ scale.
The number of synapses targeting a left-sided neuron are shown in blue; right-sided in orange.
Each is overlaid with the best-fitting normal distribution (black dashed line):
broad-PN $\mu = 3.95, \sigma = 0.24$;
ORN-PN $\mu = 4.14, \sigma = 0.33$;
LN-Basin $\mu = 4.07, \sigma = 0.28$;
cho-Basin $\mu = 4.01, \sigma = 0.29$;
and $\alpha = 0.1$ confidence intervals (green dotted line).
\textbf{Bii)} Raw $p$-values (colouring) and FWER corrected \citep*{Holm1979} significance levels for pairwise ranksum comparisons of circuit synapse area distributions.
