Results of synaptic area labelling.
\textbf{Ai)} The ssTEM images upon which the analysis is based.
\textbf{Aii)} A schematic showing the plane of a neurite sectioned in the top image, and the pre- and post-synaptic sites of that neurite and one of its partners, in orange and red respectively.
Note the T-bar, cleft and and postsynaptic membrane specialisation.
\textbf{Bi)} For each of the four circuits, the distribution of synaptic areas on a $log_{10}$ scale.
The number of synapses targeting a left-sided neuron are shown in blue; right-sided in orange.
Each is overlaid with the best-fitting normal distribution (black dashed line) and 90\% confidence interval (green dotted line).
\textbf{Bii)} Table of normal distribution parameters, in $log_{10}nm^2$ to 3 decimal places.
\textbf{Biii)} Raw $p$-values (colouring) and FWER corrected~\citep*{Holm1979} significance levels for pairwise ranksum comparisons of circuit synapse area distributions.
